# G-Bot: AI-Powered Chatbot using FastAPI & Gemini API

G-Bot is an AI-powered chatbot built using **FastAPI** for the backend and **Google's Gemini API** for AI-generated responses. The chatbot is designed to be lightweight, fast, and easy to interact with. It features a simple UI, real-time message exchanges, and is deployed for free on **Railway**.

This project serves as an interactive assistant that can understand user input and generate human-like responses through the power of generative AI.

## Project Overview

G-Bot is designed to simulate a conversation between the user and an AI model powered by Google's Gemini API. By integrating **FastAPI** with **Google Gemini API**, this chatbot can process user input and return intelligent responses in a chat interface. The backend leverages FastAPI to handle the API requests, and the frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a clean and responsive user interface.

The chatbot currently supports text-based interaction, where users can ask questions or start a conversation, and the bot generates human-like responses based on the input.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**:  
  - [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) â€“ A high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.
  - [Google Gemini API](https://developers.google.com/ai) â€“ Google's generative AI model for providing intelligent chatbot responses.
  - [CORS Middleware](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/cors/) â€“ Middleware for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for communication between the frontend and backend.

- **Frontend**:  
  - HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for building the chat interface and handling client-side interactions.
  - [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) for rendering dynamic content from the FastAPI backend.
  - [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) to send user input and retrieve responses asynchronously.

- **Deployment**:  
  - [Railway](https://railway.app/) â€“ A platform used for free deployment with ease of setup.

## Features

- **Real-Time AI Responses**: Instant chatbot replies generated by Google's Gemini API, providing a seamless user experience.
- **User-Friendly UI**: Clean, responsive chat interface that works across mobile and desktop screens.
- **Fully Responsive**: The chatbot adapts to different screen sizes for a consistent experience on both mobile and desktop.
- **Free Deployment**: The application is hosted and deployed on Railway, offering free hosting for small-scale applications.
- **Customizable UI**: The design of the chat interface is simple and customizable to fit your needs.
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Fast communication using asynchronous requests between the frontend and backend, ensuring no delays in the user experience.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/g-bot.git
   cd g-bot
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up your Gemini API key**  
   Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` in `main.py` with your own API key from Google Gemini.

   ```python
   genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
   ```

5. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   The app should now be running locally at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Video Demo

A video demo of G-Bot in action is available [here]([https://link-to-your-video.com](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wbcgs8Cx6IoozNLjeeT1jAAM8EAbTPQh/view?usp=sharing)). Watch it to see how the chatbot works in real time!

In the demo, you can see the chatbot's intelligent responses to user input and how it engages in conversations seamlessly.

## Future Enhancements

This project is just the beginning, and I plan to add the following features in the future:

- **User Authentication**: To allow for personalized conversations, such as saving chat history or user preferences.
- **Chat History**: Save and load previous conversations for the user to review past interactions with the chatbot.
- **Voice Input**: Integrate speech-to-text functionality to allow users to interact with the bot using voice commands.
- **Mobile-Friendly Design Improvements**: Further optimize the user interface for a better mobile experience.
- **Advanced Chat Features**: Add advanced features like context awareness, topic management, or multi-turn conversations.
